                    <p class="center">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the 
                    look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. While most often used to
                    style web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, 
                    the language can be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain
                    XML, SVG and XUL. CSS is a cornerstone specification of the web and almost 
                    all web pages use CSS style sheets to describe their presentation.</p>
                    <p class="center">HTML or HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language used to create web pages.
               HTML is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets (like html). 
                HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like h1 and /h1, although some tags represent empty elements and 
                so are unpaired, for example img. The first tag in a pair is the start tag, and the second tag is the end tag 
                (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).</p>
